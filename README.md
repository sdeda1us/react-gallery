# React Gallery 



## Description

Duration: Weekend - 12 hours

This full stack SERN application allows the user to browse a photo gallery of things that are important to the author. Clicking on the image toggles the image off and reveals a text description of the image. Clicking on the 'Love it!' button adds a vote to the total loves for the photo. 

The application's data is hosted on a SQL server, and the application can get data and modify data in the database.

The full stack application is available for use on [heroku by clicking here: ](https://shielded-inlet-68730.herokuapp.com/).
